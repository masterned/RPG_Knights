# RPG Knights
## The Project
This is a home-brew pen-and-paper role-playing system.
It will include a database of current game props - races, items, lands, and abilities.
I also hope to create a simple UI for accessing information regarding the game (whether it be rules, props, news or otherwise).

## The Game
The rule set will be loosely based off of GURPS and BISM.
The focus behind the system will be to simplify the game to allow even new players to be able to be GM easily.
I hope to make the game adaptable to different play styles,
and encourage creativity.
Rather than creating a game that is difficult and challenging in total,
I hope to create a system that - though it's base is more casual - is fun for anyone playing,
not just those who have played for a long time.

  ### Some Particulars
  * design the stats to be radar chart friendly
  * use a no-sql database to store game information
  * use web2.0 paradigm for user app
